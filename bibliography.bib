abstract = {The focus of the paper is the problem of foot rotation in biped$\backslash$nrobots during the single support phase. Foot rotation is an indication$\backslash$nof postural instability and should be carefully treated in a dynamically$\backslash$nstable walk and avoided altogether in a statically stable walk. We$\backslash$nintroduce the foot rotation indicator (FRI) point which is a point on$\backslash$nthe foot/ground contact surface where the net ground reaction force$\backslash$nwould have to act to keep the foot stationary. To ensure no foot$\backslash$nrotation, the FRI point must remain within the convex hull of the foot$\backslash$nsupport area. In contrast with the ground projection of the center of$\backslash$nmass (GCoM), which is a static criterion, the FRI point incorporates the$\backslash$nrobot dynamics. As opposed to the center of pressure (CoP)-better known$\backslash$nas the zero moment point (ZMP) in the robotics literature-which may not$\backslash$nleave the support area, the FRI point may. Due to these important$\backslash$nproperties the FRI point helps not only to monitor the state of static$\backslash$nstability of a biped robot during the entire gait cycle, but indicates$\backslash$nthe stability robustness or the severity of instability of the gait as$\backslash$nwell. In response to a recent need the paper also resolves the$\backslash$nmisconceptions surrounding the CoP/ZMP equivalence},

This paper is devoted to the permanence of the concept of Zero - Moment Point , widely - known by the acronym ZMP . Thirty - five years have elapsed since its implicit presentation (actually before being named ZMP) to the scientific community and thirty - three years since it was explicitly introduced and clearly elaborated , initially in the leading journals published in English . Its first practical demonstration took place in Japan in 1984 , at Waseda University , Laboratory of Ichiro Kato , in the first dynamically balanced robot WL - 10RD of the robotic family WABOT . The paper gives an in - depth discussion of source results concerning ZMP , paying particular attention to some delicate issues that may lead to confusion if this method is applied in a mechanistic manner onto irregular cases of artificial gait , i . e . in the case of loss of dynamic balance of a humanoid robot . After a short survey of the history of the origin of ZMP a very detailed elaboration of ZMP notion is given , with a special review concerning " boundary cases " when the ZMP is close to the edge of the support polygon and " fictious cases " when the ZMP should be outside the support polygon . In addition , the difference between ZMP and the center of pressure is pointed out . Finally , some unresolved or insufficiently treated phenomena that may yield a significant improvement in robot performance are considered .},

abstract = {The connection between the dynamics of an object and the algorithmic level has been modified in this paper, based on two-level control. The central modification consists in introducing feedbacks, that is, a system of regulators at the level of the formed typed of gait only. Such a modification originates from the assump- tion that a very narrow class of gait types needs to be taken into ac- count when generating the gait. In the paper the gait has been formed on the basis of a fixed program having a kinematic-dynamic char- acter. The kinematic part concerns the kinematic programnmed connections for activating the lower extremities, while the dynamic part exposes appropriate changes in the characteristic coordinates of the compensation system. Such a connection with a minimum number of coordinates extends the possibility of solving the problem of equilibrium in motion for one type of gait without any particular algorithm that would take into account the motion coordinates and form out of them a stable motion at a higher algebraic level.},

@article{Merker2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) frequently have affected ankle joints, which can lead to foot deformities such as pes planovalgus (JIA-PPV). Usually, JIA-PPV is diagnosed by examining the foot in non-weightbearing or in weightbearing, static condition. However, functional limitations typically appear during dynamic use in daily activities such as walking. The aim of this study was to quantify the pathophysiology of JIA-PPV in both static and dynamic condition, i.e. in upright standing and during the stance phase of walking using three-dimensional (3d) gait analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Eleven JIA patients (age = 12y) with at least one affected ankle joint and fixed pes planovalgus (≥5°) were compared to healthy controls (CG) (n = 14, age = 11y). Kinematic and kinetic data were obtained in barefoot standing and walking condition (1.1-1.3 m/s) with an 8-camera 3d motion analysis system including two force-plates and one pressure distribution plate. All participants were prepared using reflecting markers according to the Oxford Foot and Plug-in-Gait Model. Results were compared using the Mann-Whitney-U-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p {\textless} 0.05).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In comparison to CG, JIA-PPV had an excessive hindfoot/tibia eversion (p {\textless} 0.001) and a forefoot/hindfoot supination (p {\textless} 0.001) in both static and walking condition. JIA-PPV showed a greater hindfoot/tibia eversion during walking (midstance) compared to standing (p = 0.021) in contrast to CG. The arch index, measured by plantar pressure distribution, indicates a reduced arch height in JIA-PPV (p = 0.007). Patients had a lower maximum dorsiflexion of hindfoot/tibia (p = 0.001) and a lower plantarflexion of forefoot/hindfoot (p = 0.028), both when standing and walking. The kinetic results showed lower maximum ankle dorsiflexion moments (p {\textless} 0.037) as well as generated ankle power (p = 0.086) in JIA-PPV.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The pathophysiology of JIA-PPV during walking indicated that excessive hindfoot eversion produces accessory symptoms such as a reduced arch height, increased forefoot supination and reduced propulsion effect of the ankle. Muscular and coordinative insufficiency caused by arthritis can lead to the observed increased hindfoot eversion from static to dynamic condition. Conventional static or passive foot examination techniques probably underestimate deformity in JIA pes planovalgus. 3d gait analysis might be helpful in early diagnosis of this condition, especially in JIA patients with affected ankle joints.},

abstract = {This paper builds up on the Capture Point concept and exploits the simple form of the dynamical equations of the Linear Inverted Pendulum model when formulated in terms of the center of mass and the Capture Point. The presented methods include (i) the derivation of a Capture Point (CP) control principle based on the natural dynamics of the linear inverted pendulum (LIP), which stabilizes the walking robot and motivates (ii) the design of a CP tracking and a CP end-of-step controller. The exponential stability of the CP control law is proven. Tilting is avoided by proper projection of the commanded zero moment point. The robustness of the derived control algorithms is analyzed analytically and verified in simulation and experiments.},

abstract = {It is known that for a large magnitude push a human or a humanoid robot must take a step to avoid a fall. Despite some scattered results, a principled approach towards "when and where to take a step" has not yet emerged. Towards this goal, we present methods for computing capture points and the capture region, the region on the ground where a humanoid must step to in order to come to a complete stop. The intersection between the capture region and the base of support determines which strategy the robot should adopt to successfully stop in a given situation. Computing the capture region for a humanoid, in general, is very difficult. However, with simple models of walking, computation of the capture region is simplified. We extend the well-known linear inverted pendulum model to include a flywheel body and show how to compute exact solutions of the capture region for this model. Adding rotational inertia enables the humanoid to control its centroidal angular momentum, much like the way human beings do, significantly enlarging the capture region. We present simulations of a simple planar biped that can recover balance after a push by stepping to the capture region and using internal angular momentum. Ongoing work involves applying the solution from the simple model as an approximate solution to more complex simulations of bipedal walking, including a 3D biped with distributed mass.},
