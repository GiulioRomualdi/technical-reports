abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) frequently have affected ankle joints, which can lead to foot deformities such as pes planovalgus (JIA-PPV). Usually, JIA-PPV is diagnosed by examining the foot in non-weightbearing or in weightbearing, static condition. However, functional limitations typically appear during dynamic use in daily activities such as walking. The aim of this study was to quantify the pathophysiology of JIA-PPV in both static and dynamic condition, i.e. in upright standing and during the stance phase of walking using three-dimensional (3d) gait analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Eleven JIA patients (age = 12y) with at least one affected ankle joint and fixed pes planovalgus (≥5°) were compared to healthy controls (CG) (n = 14, age = 11y). Kinematic and kinetic data were obtained in barefoot standing and walking condition (1.1-1.3 m/s) with an 8-camera 3d motion analysis system including two force-plates and one pressure distribution plate. All participants were prepared using reflecting markers according to the Oxford Foot and Plug-in-Gait Model. Results were compared using the Mann-Whitney-U-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p {\textless} 0.05).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In comparison to CG, JIA-PPV had an excessive hindfoot/tibia eversion (p {\textless} 0.001) and a forefoot/hindfoot supination (p {\textless} 0.001) in both static and walking condition. JIA-PPV showed a greater hindfoot/tibia eversion during walking (midstance) compared to standing (p = 0.021) in contrast to CG. The arch index, measured by plantar pressure distribution, indicates a reduced arch height in JIA-PPV (p = 0.007). Patients had a lower maximum dorsiflexion of hindfoot/tibia (p = 0.001) and a lower plantarflexion of forefoot/hindfoot (p = 0.028), both when standing and walking. The kinetic results showed lower maximum ankle dorsiflexion moments (p {\textless} 0.037) as well as generated ankle power (p = 0.086) in JIA-PPV.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The pathophysiology of JIA-PPV during walking indicated that excessive hindfoot eversion produces accessory symptoms such as a reduced arch height, increased forefoot supination and reduced propulsion effect of the ankle. Muscular and coordinative insufficiency caused by arthritis can lead to the observed increased hindfoot eversion from static to dynamic condition. Conventional static or passive foot examination techniques probably underestimate deformity in JIA pes planovalgus. 3d gait analysis might be helpful in early diagnosis of this condition, especially in JIA patients with affected ankle joints.},

abstract = {This paper builds up on the Capture Point concept and exploits the simple form of the dynamical equations of the Linear Inverted Pendulum model when formulated in terms of the center of mass and the Capture Point. The presented methods include (i) the derivation of a Capture Point (CP) control principle based on the natural dynamics of the linear inverted pendulum (LIP), which stabilizes the walking robot and motivates (ii) the design of a CP tracking and a CP end-of-step controller. The exponential stability of the CP control law is proven. Tilting is avoided by proper projection of the commanded zero moment point. The robustness of the derived control algorithms is analyzed analytically and verified in simulation and experiments.},

abstract = {It is known that for a large magnitude push a human or a humanoid robot must take a step to avoid a fall. Despite some scattered results, a principled approach towards "when and where to take a step" has not yet emerged. Towards this goal, we present methods for computing capture points and the capture region, the region on the ground where a humanoid must step to in order to come to a complete stop. The intersection between the capture region and the base of support determines which strategy the robot should adopt to successfully stop in a given situation. Computing the capture region for a humanoid, in general, is very difficult. However, with simple models of walking, computation of the capture region is simplified. We extend the well-known linear inverted pendulum model to include a flywheel body and show how to compute exact solutions of the capture region for this model. Adding rotational inertia enables the humanoid to control its centroidal angular momentum, much like the way human beings do, significantly enlarging the capture region. We present simulations of a simple planar biped that can recover balance after a push by stepping to the capture region and using internal angular momentum. Ongoing work involves applying the solution from the simple model as an approximate solution to more complex simulations of bipedal walking, including a 3D biped with distributed mass.},

abstract = {For 3D walking control of a biped robot we analyze the dynamics of a 3D inverted pendulum in which motion is constrained to move along an arbitrarily defined plane. This analysis yields a simple linear dynamics, the 3D linear inverted pendulum mode (3D-LIPM). Geometric nature of trajectories under the 3D-LIPM and a method for walking pattern generation are discussed. A simulation result of a walking control using a 12-DOF biped robot model is also shown},
